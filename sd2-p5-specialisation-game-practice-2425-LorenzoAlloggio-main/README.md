# Top down shooter

## Where to find info?
In the 'sintlucas' folder there are all the files and you need.
The FDD contains a description of all the features that should be inside the game.
The TDD contains information on how the product should be developed, along with links to tutorials, documentation and even aan table displaying nearly all the scripts needed.

## Intro
[In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of game development. You will learn to create a simple topdown 2D game. For this you will use various different coding techniques to make sure you keep a good workflow.]

## Planning
This assignment will be done in 4 weeks. The last lesson of the period will be reserved for feedback and to add everything to your portfolio.
### Week 1:
* Briefing, Github setup, New input system, Vectors, Movement
* Instantiate, Collision, Raycasts
### Week 2:
* Inheritance, UI 
* Lists
### Week 3:
* Singleton
* Tilemaps, audio, animations
### Week 4:
* Catching up
* Deadline

## Learning goals
* V6: Je realiseert prototypes die werken en voldoen aan de opdracht, het ontwerp en de hierbij geldende codeconventies.
* V7: Je kunt je code op regelniveau uitleggen en gebruikt daarvoor de juiste terminologie.
* V8: Je werkt in de door de opleiding voorgeschreven ontwikkelsoftware.
* V9: Je kan een aangeleverde testmethodiek toepassen om je code te testen.
* V10: Je kan zelfstandig errors oplossen.

## Objectives
* Using the new Unity input system
* Using and understanding inheritance
* Using Lists
* Using singletons

## Conclusion
You will have to push your work to github constantly. This is the place where you will hand in your work.
You will also upload this work to your portfolio.
You will be graded on meeting the requirements, clean code and your work ethics in class.

### Requirements:
* Use the new input system
* Use inheritance
* Use a list
* Use a singleton
* Create a simple game

### You will do this by doing the following:
* Have basic player movement
* Shooting
* Enemies
* UI displaying score
* Locked doors and keys
* The use of tilemaps and visuals
* The use of audio

## Evaluation
You will be graded on meeting the technical requirements and your work ethics in class.
The grade you'll be giving will be on a scale of O, V, G (onvoldoende, voldoende, goed).

### Technical requirements
O = You can be granted an O if your project lacks too many requirements, contains code of poor quality or if you are not able to explain your own code.
V = You can be granted a V if your project meets the set requirements and follows the assignment.
G = You can be granted a G if you meet all the requirements and improve upon the game with additional features or polishing.

### Work ethics
O = You can be granted an O for often being late to class, being absent, being disruptive or by not putting any effort into your work.
V = You can be granted a V by default.
G = You can be granted a G for having good attendance in class and showing effort in your work.
